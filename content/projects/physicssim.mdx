            This physics simulator was created within Processing as a project for my AP Computer Science Principles Exam. It simulates ball collision and obstacle collision.
            The amount of balls can be changed through the code and each ball has its own velocity and acceleration. Many of the functions used were based on real equations.
            Click on the frame and press W to make the balls jump, A to make the balls shift left, and D to shift the balls right.
