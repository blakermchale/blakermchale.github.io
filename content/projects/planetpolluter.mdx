        <p>This project was created in Unity for the NASA Space Apps International Challenge.
            The goal of our project was to raise awareness about climate change and create a fun
            interactive way for people to see how their actions affect the world. The goal of our game
            "Planet Polluter" is to end the world by causing the CO2 to levels to exceed 500 ppm. In
            this prototype, the game has functions for creating factories, collecting money, and
            causing temperature change.
        </p>

            At the local Boston hackathon our project won first place and was entered into the global
            competition. We plan to add more features such as public awareness, sea level, and heat maps
            to make this game a more complete and realistic simulation.
