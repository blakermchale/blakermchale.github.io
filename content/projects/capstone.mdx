description: '
Project building a large dodecacopter (UHL) for delivery and retrieval of smaller UAVs. Controls are done with a modified 
version of PX4 using RTPS. RTPS is a communication framework that allows for ROS2 to directly interface with the PX4
firmware. ROS2 is used as the main infrastructure for communicating commands and retrieving
data from sensors. Missions are performed with a behavior tree library developed by our club in C++. The main mission 
involves dropping UAVs from our UHL and then having them catch themselves mid-air using a custom `Drop` mode we added.
The UAVs will then perform a search mission and reintegrate back into the UHL through precision landing on ArUco markers.

**NOTE:** This is still a work in progress

## Introduction  
For my final engineering capstone my friends and I are building a system for deploying
and reintegrating a swarm of UAVs. The system consists of a dodecacopter called the
"carrier drone" and six custom built and designed quadcopters "called swarm drones".
These six swarm drones are held inside a mechanism on the carrier drone and then
carried to a mission location and dropped. The drone's will automatically catch
themselves and perform the mission. Once done they return to the carrier drones
landing location and autonomously precision land back into the vehicle.

## The Team
This project is being worked on by my friends and I seen below:  
Noah Ossanna (Mechanical), John Buczek (Electrical), Michael Tang (Mechanical),
Blake McHale (Software), Josh Field (Software), Erik Little (Mechanical)

## Software
There are three primary systems to software: flight control, swarm communication,
and mission path planning.  
Heavy focus has been placed on flight control as that is the most vital aspect of
this system and required at completion of the project. Swarm communication and
mission path planning are extra goals added on. 

### Flight Control
For controlling the drones PX4 and RTPS are used along with ROS2. A basic library
called `companion_computing` is being developed for easily sending commands to the
vehicle, such as positions and velocities. There are also fundamental actions:
takeoff, land, arm, disarm, kill, precision land, and drop.  
The last two are in heavy development and testing. They are custom implemented
into `companion_computing` and the PX4 flight stack itself.

## Hardware
Outside of software a lot of work has been done by my friends who are mechanical
and electrical. Slight additions were added by Josh and I, such as a lot of the
testing and setup for sensors and the flight controller. I had a heavy hand in
connecting the PX4 flight controller to our onboard computer and establishing
appropriate parameters.
