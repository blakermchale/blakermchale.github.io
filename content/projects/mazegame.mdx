            During my freshman year Cornerstone of Engineering II class I developed and designed a maze game with a controller.
            I worked on this project in conjuction with Scott Young and Will Decramer. I acted as a game design and controller lead, while
            my other partners worked on CAD design and an interface for another part of the project. This game was built as one of many
            puzzles in an escape room that was open to the public for one day. For this Escape Room I helped design the narrative and this
            game. Our theme for the escape room was about being trapped in a military base where two AI are fighting for control. The room changed
            depending on your input as the user and each puzzle offered two solutions. This maze was meant to be played with a controller, but it can also be played through the use of 'W','A','S', and 'D'.
            The '1' key will reset your sprite back at the beginning.
