								Northeastern Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (NUAV) is a club that my friends and I started during my sophomore year. Initially, it started
                                as a drone racing club but as our ambitions grew the club expanded to cover research. The
                                club was founded under AerospaceNU, a larger Northeastern aerospace club that originally
                                focused primarily on rocket research projects.

                                NUAV's direct research focus is on the development of UAV robotic systems to accomplish tasks.
                                In this section I will cover primarily the software aspects, as I led the software subgroup for
                                most of college and provided support to new leadership during my final year.
                            </p>
